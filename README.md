This repository houses some VERY basic instructions for cloning, building, and using the Liquid Galaxy activities for systems powered by Interactive Spaces.

This repo also houses a manifest for use with Google's "git-repo" (https://gerrit.googlesource.com/git-repo/).
Use repo as follows to download all of the activities at once:
```
repo init -u git@github.com:EndPointCorp/lg-ispaces-activities.git
```
